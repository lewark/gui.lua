This is a basic GUI toolkit for CC:Tweaked. Currently, the widgets include:

* LinearContainer
* Label
* Button
* TextField
* TextArea (unfinished)
* ListBox
* ScrollBar

The library can be installed from pastebin:

```
pastebin get WpnbkREi gui.lua
```

Documentation is currently unfinished. See `demo.lua` for a usage example. Or look at [inv.lua](https://github.com/knector01/inv.lua) to see it used in an actual program.
